Let us start off with the definition of what an ECR is. Everyone loves definitions! According to the Oxford English Dictionaryâ€¦ Just kidding. I will not open this can of worms by trying to define the differences and overlaps between doctoral students/candidates/researchers, post-docs, junior faculty, and ECR. In the end, we are talking about a moving target that is constantly shifting with the changes in its socio-economic framework. The hunt for tenure is becoming increasingly competitive with an ever increasing number of graduates, while the number of available jobs does not grow proportionally (https://www.pnas.org/content/115/50/12616). Imposter syndrome is well known graduate students, and an exclusive language and understanding of the involved actors in science is not helpful.
