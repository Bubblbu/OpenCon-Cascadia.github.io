Lucille Moore is a Ph.D. candidate in Neuroscience. Her research explores specialized neuronal communication and anatomical pathways of the central auditory system using in vitro electrophysiology. Luci is passionate about creating a more equitable scientific and global community and deconstructing power dynamics created and upheld by ownership and accessibility of information. To this end, Luci advocates for open science at OHSU by educating her graduate community about open philosophy and practices. She also works as a founding member of the Alliance for Visible Diversity in Science to promote recruitment, retention, and support of graduate students from historically underrepresented backgrounds in academia.
