Daniela is neuroscience Ph.D. Candidate and community organizer passionate about bringing open practices into the world of academia as a means to improve reproducibility and collaboration. Her Ph.D. research combines in vivo electrophysiology, behavior, and computational modeling to understand how sound is processed in the dynamic brain. Daniela is also a Mozilla Fellow 2018-2019. During her fellowship, she will be working on a project she co-founded in September 2017 called PREreview, an open platform and community to facilitate the collaborative writing of preprint reviews and the training of early-career researchers in scientific peer review. Through this work, she hopes to foster a broader and much needed cultural change in the way science is evaluated and disseminated.
