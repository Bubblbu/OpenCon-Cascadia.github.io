My name is Jonathan Uriarte-Lopez, but I often go by “Johnny.” I am a senior undergraduate researcher
enrolled at Portland State University majoring in Biochemistry. I am currently a part of the NIH BUILD
EXITO program and the Robert E. McNair Scholars program at PSU. Through these programs, I work at
the Developmental Cognition and Neuroimaging Lab (DCAN) at Oregon Health &amp; Science University. I
work on a project with my mentor Dr. Feczko to assess and improve the quality of standardized publicly
available datasets in neuroimaging for the purpose of autism research. My research involves
standardizing the ABIDE dataset using up to date computing pipelines to adhere to best standards and
practices in neuroimaging. My current career goals is to obtain my MD/Ph.D. to help serve
underprivileged and underrepresented communities in healthcare, as well perform research in the field
of neuroscience whether by studying autism or traumatic brain injuries. Outside of academia, I am an
avid gamer, a sports enthusiast, or laughing at a stand-up comedy show.
